It has always annoyed me when people proclaimed that they _always wanted to learn to play the piano_ or any other skill as if it was ever too late.

_I wish I could code_. Well, how do you think anyone ever learnt anything? They put in some time. And, if you're really serious about that wish, this is the only way to do it. _But I don't have the time_! you say and you are wrong.

What you don't have is either the motivation or a clear enough idea of how to start.

This is not to get all \#hustle on you but you have time. Exchange one of the TV shows you watch with learning to code a little bit. One season of Game of Thrones is, what, at least 10 hours? I promise you that you can make your own, your very own, home grown website in 10 hours or less. Especially if you call those 10 hours a _deadline_.

Unsurmountable tasks like "☑️ learn to code" or "☑️ learn to play the piano" are daunting **because** they're impossible to ever _finish_. When is anyone _done_ learning to code? I'm certainly not and I've been going for over 15 years. People die having had successful programming careers yet still _learning to code_.

This is just to say that, you do absolutely have time to learn to code _something_. Perhaps, start out with the task of creating as much of a personal website as possible in 10 hours. This works if you don't know anything about coding and it works if you're a pro.

The deadline makes sure you don't waste too much time on details or the fact that there are things you don't know yet. You're a smart, capable person. You can look things up if you need to.

I promise you, if you do this, you will feel like you can do anything _and_ you're now at least 10 hours into the life-long task of _learning to code_.
