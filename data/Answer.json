I spent the whole weekend making a website about... nothing? and I had the best time doing it. Found a few friends with the same interest in this weird medium. We'd keep redoing our own websites every month or few weeks even, always trying to one-up or just impress each other.

{"id":25,"questionId":25,"body":"I got started programming by building my own website when I was 12. Having nothing else to share but \"Welcome to my homepage!\" I just kept redoing it. A few of my friends did the same and trying to impress each other we learnt more and more things, eventually upgrading from static HTML to PHP and then adding CSS and on and on. So, my background is being curious. You might already have great taste but if not you need to develop it. When you go about on the internet, take note of things and styles that you like. Notice trends in visual design. Sometimes everything looks skeumorphic like real world surfaces, sometimes they can't be flat enough and the slightest drop shadow is forbidden. Don't spend too much energy on whether you like these trends or not, just notice them come and go and try to discern what they're about and consider what goes into designing like that. The key isn't to know what's hot but at the forefront but to train yourself into noticing what's becoming popular, what you like and don't like and have a feeling of what goes into actually making things look in a certain way. Then all that's left is to practice. You can study without doing but to learn, you need to do. So mimic and copy and try and fail and try again. Could be building your personal website.
