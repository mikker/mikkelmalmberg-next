Seeing and reading about other people's setups is a guilty pleasure of mine. It's the sort of meta-work that can feel like a productive investment to find _juuust the right font_ and _then_ I'll do the work.

We spend so much time in front of our screens, we might as well make ourselves comfortable. And so, here are some of the things I use.

## Work

- I work from an office in our house in Aalborg, Denmark. I grew up here, was away for 10 years. Came back and bought a house after having kid number 2 (of 3!) It's the perfect size town to grow up in.

* My main machine is a [2021 Macbook Pro 14" M1 MAX][mbp]. If I'm at my desk, and I most likely am, it is in clamshell mode, stuck in [a vertical stand][stand], connected to a [Kensington SD5700T Thunderbolt™ 4 dock][kensington] that's connected to a [DisplayPort 1.4 switch][dpsw]. That means I just need to in one cable and everything is connected and running at a glorious 144hz. By the press of a button, the signal switches between my Mac and PC.

  - Only problem with The One Cable solution, is that one TB-4/USB-C port isn't enough bandwidth for all this _and_ my webcam. So that one connects with its own cable.

* My monitor is an [LG 27&quot; UltraGear 27GN950-B][lg]. I wanted a monitor (and only 1) that had both a high refresh rate for FPS gaming and a high resolution for general use. I'm very satisfied with this one even though it's not "Retina"-level pixel density (meaning if you squint and make an effort you can tell individual pixels apart). It's good enough. The IPS panel has beautiful colors and it's amazing to game on 27 inches at 100+ fps.

  Being a true _"gaming"_ monitor, it looks like something out of a spaceship. An absolutely horrendous looking stand and an RGB (unicorn vomit) carroussel on the back. So, to hide that a bit and because it looks nice, I've mounted it to my desk on a [Amazon Basics monitor arm][monitor-arm].

## Desk

- My desk is a [White IKEA Bekant][bekant]. It's a motorised standing desk and I do actually use it standing multiple times a week. It has a pretty neat basket of sorts for cable management underneath. I'm a bit tired of the white color though so I'm casually looking for something else.

- I have recently splashed on a Herman Miller Aeron chair. It's good but it better be with that price tag.

- I've stuck an [Aputure MC RGB][aputure] to the back of my monitor. I've tried a few things for behind-the-monitor light and this one's the best solution so far. It can be really bright white by day and a toned down orange for late night gaming. And screaming pink for those other special occasions. I would've prefered something with HomeKit support.

- The tabletop only holds my two computers, the A/V gear and the peripherals. The switches, hubs and power bricks are all stuck underneath with two-sided tape. This removes the clutter but also makes it much easier to raise and lower the table as there's only 2 cables hanging from it, power and ethernet.

## Peripherals

- My main keyboard is the [ZSA Moonlander MARK I][moonlander] with blank rainbow keycaps and custom cables - [here it is on Reddit][moonred]. It's configured with [this closer-to-normie Mac configuration][keyconf].

- My alt/gaming keyboard is a custom built [Tofu60][] with [silent Alpaca switches][alpaca] and [Cherry profile white blanks][whiteblanks]. I love how heavy it sits on my desk and how soft the switches feel. It's like typing on a stick of butter. Here it is [on Twitter](https://twitter.com/mikker/status/1416517695311384577/photo/1).

- After many years of using trackpad only, I'm back with a mouse on the regular. A [Logitech G Pro X Superlight][superlight] in white. It's amazing how lightweight it feels at 63g. Using a mouse on macOS can feel a bit wonky because of the heavy mouse acceleration. So I use [killmouseaccel][] so I can practice my FPS aim on folders and files.

- To the left of the keyboard I have an [Apple Magic Trackpad 2][trackpad] that is mostly unused now.

- I have an [XXL Glorious mousepad][mousepad] that covers both keyboard and mouse and it's wonderful.

## Audio/Video

- Next to my monitor I have a pair of [Kanto YU2 speakers][yu2]. They sound amazing but lack a bit of bass on their own so I have the accompanying subwoofer on the floor.

- When I'm in a meeting or gaming, I'm wearing a pair of [Sony WH1000XM4/B][sony]s. When I'm gaming, making music (I miss making music) or editing video, I plug them into an [EVO 4][evo] audio interface. This is mostly to combat latency but it's also very handy to be able to have your own voice mixed into the audio when talking and having an actual dial to turn things up or down.

- I'm using a mirrorless [Sony a6000][a6000] as a webcam. I've used built-in webcams and tried some dedicated USB ones and they've all been shit. An actual camera like this is an enormous upgrade in quality. It's connected via HDMI and an [Elgato Cam Link 4K][camlink]. It's mounted to my monitor mount with [a clamp][camclamp] and [an arm][camarm].

- I have a [Shure SM7B][sm7b] mic on a [RØDE PS1 arm][rodearm] connected to my audio interface. I use it for meetings and for [whispering into][whisper] to not wake the family when I'm gaming late at night.

## Gaming PC

- My PC is custom built in the [Louqe Ghost S1 (mk. 3)][ghost] case, the _Ash_ colored variant with a _Copper_ top plate. It has a custom [spine][spine], [bottom plate][bottomplate] and [feet][feet].

- Specs

  - Motherboard: Gigabyte B450 AORUS PRO WiFi
  - CPU: AMD Ryzen 5 3600X (6 cores)
  - CPU fan: Noctua NH-L12 Ghost S1 ed.
  - RAM: 16gb Corsair Vengeance LPX DDR4 3200
  - PSU: Corsair SFX SF750 Platinum
  - SSD: Crucial P1 3D NAND NVMe - 1TB
  - GPU: GIGABYTE GeForce RTX 3060 Ti GAMING OC PRO (fans deshrouded and replaced w. 2x Noctua NF-A12x15)
  - Case fan: Noctua NF-A12x25 bottom exhaust.

- I have undervolted both the CPU and GPU for a about 10&deg;C temp drop with no visible loss of performance. It runs Warzone comfortably around 100fps, topping out at about 65&deg;C with only a single exhaust fan. I tried running it with two additional exhaust fans in the medium tophat but the gains were small and the Ghost just looks so much cooler without the tophats.

## On my Mac

- I have a completely empty Desktop folder. Sometimes it serves as a holding area for a file or two but most of the time it's competely empty.

- I never use my Dock for launching apps. It too is mostly empty, holding only Finder, the apps that are currently running, a Downloads folder stack and the Trash. I have it on the bottom edge set to auto-hide.

### Software

- My favourite editor is [vim][] inside [tmux][] inside [iTerm2][] nightlies. I switched to vim over 10 years ago and never figured out how to quit it (haha)
- My colorscheme is a custom version of the [paramount][] theme. Every now and then I change up the colors which is easy because there's mainly just one accent color and the rest is grayscale-ish. I use [Iosevka][] which is just delightful.
- Safari is my browser. I like Firefox but nothing beats Safari's speed and OS integration. I'm a heavy user of Reading List for saving links for later and that only works in Safari. I hate using Chrome as it feels bloated and icky with all the _Google_.
- I use Mail.app for email.
- Apple Music for music that's not YouTube synthwave mixtapes. Yes, I am the only person using Apple Music but it's good now. Only thing I miss from Spotify is Discover Weekly but I use Spotify for kids' music so now that's completely messed up.
- [Things][] for todos which is mostly the same repeating list I (fail to) run through each day. Todo lists are really great but I have to force myself to use them. It just doesn't come naturally.
- A combination of [VimR][] with [Vimwiki][], [iA Writer][], [nvAlt][] and [Notion][] for personal notes. It's a mess and I'm never satisfied. Part of it is that I'm bad at keeping notes and part of it is not knowing what it is that I want to capture in those notes. But having good notes looks like a superpower so I keep struggling.
- [Quicksilver][] for launching apps and scripts. [It's better than all the alternatives][better-qs].
- [Hammerspoon][] for general shortcuts, window management presets and [more][hammerspoon-conf].
- [Moves][] for mouse controlled window management (I made it!)
- [Sprinkles][] to mod websites (I made it!)
- [Pastebot][] for clipboard history.
- [1password][] for password management.
- [CleanShotX][] for screenshots.
- [Battery Buddy][] because it's cute.
- [Espanso][] for text expansion.
- [Hand Mirror][] and [Webcam Settings][] for calls.
- [Sketch][] for vector graphics.
- [Acorn][] for raster graphics.
- [Slack][] for chatting with co-workers, friends and generally not getting shit done.
- [Discord][] for gaming with friends and not reading NFT servers.
- Apple Photos for photos.
- Time Machine and [BackBlaze][] for backups.

## On my PC

- Call of Duty Warzone and Apex Legends. Battle Royals are so much fun.
