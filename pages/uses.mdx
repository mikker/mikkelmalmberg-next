Seeing and reading about other people's setups is a guilty pleasure of mine. It's the sort of meta-work that can feel like a productive investment to get _just the right font_ when in reality the font doesn't matter at all &mdash; it's the words, dummy.

Yet, it's interesting to see how others conduct their work and the tools they use. And so, here are some of the things I use.

## Work

I work from home and like it. I guess most do now, but I also did before the pandemic.

* My main machine is a [2019 Macbook Pro 16&quot;][mbp]. If I'm at my desk, and I most likely am, it is in clamshell mode, stuck in [a vertical stand][stand], connected to a [CalDigit TS3+ Thunderbolt hub][caldigit] and a [DisplayPort switch][dpsw]. That means I just need to plug in two cables and everything is connected. I could save a cable by using the DisplayPort on the CalDigit, but then I'd have to live with macOS only using 60 of the 144Hz available. By the press of a button, the signal switches over to my PC.

* My monitor is an [LG 27&quot; UltraGear 27GN950-B][lg]. I wanted a monitor (and only 1) that had both a high refresh rate for FPS gaming and a high resolution for general use. I'm very satisfied with this one even though it's not "Retina"-level pixel density, meaning if you squint you can see individual pixels. It's good enough. The IPS panel has beautiful colors and it's amazing to game on 27 inches at 100+ fps.

  Being a _"gaming"_ monitor it has the looks of something out of a spaceship. An absolutely horrendous looking stand and a RGB unicorn vomit carroussel on the back. So, to hide that a bit and because it looks nice, I've mounted it to my desk on a [Amazon Basics monitor arm][monitor-arm].

## Desk

* My desk is a [White IKEA Bekant][bekant]. It's a motorised standing desk and I do actually use it standing multiple times a week. It has a pretty neat basket of sorts for cable management underneath. I don't really like the white color though so I'm looking for something else.

* My chair is an [IKEA Markus chair][markus]. I don't really like it, actually. Best thing about it is the [replacement wheels][wheels]. I have recently splashed on a Hermal Miller chair that I'm impatiently waiting to have delivered.

* I've stuck an [Aputure MC RGB][aputure] stuck to the back of my monitor. I've tried a few things for behind-the-monitor light and this one's the best solution so far. I would've prefered to be able to control it via WiFi instead of Bluetooth so I could control it with HomeKit but it's fine.

* The table only holds my two computers, the A/V gear and the peripherals. The switches, hubs and power bricks are all stuck underneath with two-sided tape. This removes the clutter but also makes it much easier to raise and lower the table as there's only 2 cables hanging from it, power and ethernet.

## Peripherals

* When I'm working I'm usually wearing my [Sony WH1000XM4/B][sony]s. When I'm gaming or sometimes making music (too seldom) or editing video, I plug them into an [EVO 4][evo] audio interface. This is mostly to combat latency but it's also very handy to be able to have your own voice mixed into the audio and having an actual dial to turn things up or down.

* My main keyboard is the [ZSA Moonlander MARK I][moonlander] with blank rainbow keycaps and custom cables. It's configured with this [at little more normie configuration][keyconf]. I use it with an [Apple Magic Trackpad 2][trackpad]. For gaming I use a [HHKB Pro 2][hhkb] and a [Wired matte black Glorious Model O- mouse][modelo] because I have small and delicate lady hands. I wish they made the smaller size in a wireless variant. I have them placed on a [XXL Glorious mousepad][mousepad].

## Audio/Video

* I have recently bought a used [Sony a6000][a6000] for use as a general camera that doubles as a webcam. I used to use a [Logitech C920][c920] but I never really liked it. The full-body camera is a huuuge upgrade. I connect it via HDMI and an [Elgato Cam Link 4K][camlink]. It's sitting on a cheap tripod behind my monitor.

* I have a [Shure SM7B][sm7b] mic on a [RÃ˜DE PS1 arm][rodearm] connected to my audio interface. For normal meetings I usually just use the mic in my bluetooth headphones so the SM7B is currently mostly used as the world's most overpowered gaming mic.

## Gaming PC

* My PC is custom built in the [Louqe Ghost S1 (mk. 3)][ghost] case, the _Ash_ colored variant with a _Copper_ top plate. It has a custom [spine][spine], [bottom plate][bottomplate] and [feet][feet].

* Specs
  - Motherboard: Gigabyte B450 AORUS PRO WiFi
  - CPU: AMD Ryzen 5 3600X (6 cores)
  - CPU fan: Noctua NH-L12 Ghost S1 ed.
  - RAM: 16gb Corsair Vengeance LPX DDR4 3200
  - PSU: Corsair SFX SF750 Platinum
  - SSD: Crucial P1 3D NAND NVMe - 1TB
  - GPU: GIGABYTE GeForce RTX 3060 Ti GAMING OC PRO (fans deshrouded and replaced w. 2x Noctua NF-A12x15)
  - Case fan: Noctua NF-A12x25 bottom exhaust.

* I have undervolted both the CPU and GPU for a about 10&deg;C temp drop with no visible loss of performance. It runs Warzone comfortably above 100fps, topping out at about 65&deg;C.

## On my Mac

* I have a completely empty Desktop. Sometimes it serves as a holding area for a file or two but most of the time it's competely empty.
* I never use my Dock for launching apps. It too is completely empty, holding only the apps that are currently running. I have it on the bottom edge, set to auto-hide.

### Software

* [vim][] inside [tmux][] inside [iTerm2][] nightlies. My colorscheme is a custom version of the [paramount][] theme. Every now and then I change up the colors which is easy because there's mainly just one accent color and the rest is grayscale-ish. I use [Iosevka][] which is the best font every made. This website uses it too.
* Safari is my main browser. I like Firefox but nothing beats Safari's speed and integration. I'm a heavy user of Reading List for saving links for later and that only works in Safari. I hate using Chrome but I use it for Elastic email and calendar.
* [HEY][] for email. It's nice to try something new. I use it in Safari and not the app so I can [mod it with Sprinkles][mailmod].
* Apple Music for music that's not YouTube mixtapes. Yes, I am the only person using Apple Music but it's actully good now.
* [Things][] for todos which is mostly the same repeating list I run through each day.
* A combination of [VimR][] with [Vimwiki][], [iA Writer][] and [Notion][] for personal notes. It's a mess and I'm never completely satisfied.
* [Quicksilver][] for launching apps and scripts.
* [Hammerspoon][] for general shortcuts and [more][hammerspoon-conf].
* [Moves][] to move windows (I made it!)
* [Sprinkles][] to mod websites (I made it!)
* [Pastebot][] for clipboard history.
* [1password][] for password management.
* [CleanShotX][] for screenshots.
* [Battery Buddy][] because it's cute.
* [Espanso][] for text expansion.
* [Hand Mirror][] and [Webcam Settings][] for video calls.
* [Sketch][] for vector graphics.
* [Acorn][] for raster graphics.
* [Slack][] for talking to co-workers, friends and generally not getting shit done.
* Apple Photos for photos.
* Time Machine and [BackBlaze][] for backups.

## On my PC

* Call of Duty Warzone and Apex Legends. Battle Royals are so much fun.
* Discord for hectic battle communication and lame jokes late at night with friends.
